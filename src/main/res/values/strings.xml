  <string name="title_why_permissions">Why all these Permissions?</string>
  <string name="content_why_permissions">The permissions required by Power Manager are requested to allow the application to control certain physical radios on the device. For example, Power Manager needs to be able to access and control the Wifi and Network permissions to access and change the state of Wifi and Mobile Data. It requires access as well to Bluetooth and Sync permissions for similar reasons. It also can request the launch on startup permission to allow users to start the application with the device if they so desire.</string>
  <string name="title_help_out">How can I help out?</string>
  <string name="content_help_out"><![CDATA[Power Manager is developed in the Open on <a href=\"https://github.com/pyamsoft/power-manager\">GitHub</a>. If you know a few things about Android programming and are wanting to help out with development you can do so by creating issue tickets to squash bugs, and propose feature requests for future inclusion.]]></string>
  <string name="content_what_are_triggers">Power Triggers are user defined commands which are set to run at a specified battery percent. Power Triggers will run instantly whether the screen is on or off, and will instantly affect the state of the device. Power Triggers can range from doing a large number of operations, to doing effectively nothing and simply notifying the user about a certain battery level.</string>
  <string name="title_what_are_triggers">What are Power Triggers?</string>
  <string name="title_what_are_plans">What are Power Plans?</string>
  <string name="content_what_are_plans">Power Plans are predefined settings which control how Power Manager attempts to handle device radios and interfaces. The Power Plan controls how aggresively Power Manager will look to turn off functions of the device to save power, ranging from extremely lax to hyper aggressive instant response. The standard plan is geared towards fitting most user needs.</string>
  <string name="title_how_use">How do I Use This?</string>
  <string name="content_how_use">"Power Manager is designed as a 'set it and forget it' type of application. You can toggle the settings and tweak them to your personal needs once, and then close the application and rest easy knowing that Power Manager will only ever do what you tell it to "</string>
  <string name="title_what_is">What is Power Manager?</string>
  <string name="content_what_is">Power Manager is a free, open source application which seeks to save power on Android devices by turning off functions like Wifi and Bluetooth when the device\'s screen is off and not being actively used. It reaches this goal through the use of standard Android functions and permissions</string>
