Power Manager Android application by pyamsoft

# Unmaintained

Power Manager is no longer maintained and is no longer available on the Play Store. 

Android has improved as an OS to the point that a third-party application such as this one is  
no longer needed for device battery usage to be efficient and reasonable. Newer versions of the  
OS (which are years old at the time of writing) are all more efficient on their own than a third  
party application like Power Manager could ever make things. At this point, almost any third  
party battery manager application will actually consume more power and cause more instability  
than running the system normally.

Power Manager was only ever officially available on the Play Store. Any other  
distribution is unofficial and unsupported - and unsecured.

This repository continues to exist only as source code.

No further releases will be published for any reason.
